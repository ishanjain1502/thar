Each team will try to cross the arena with obstacles in the least amount of time. There will be 3 obstacles (stages) coming one after another and some random stationary supplies and objects will be placed beside each obstacle from which the teams have to improvise a solution. Failing to cooperate with the requests of the organisers will make a team liable for instant disqualification. Using any material other than what is provided at each stage will result in instant disqualification. Causing damage to the arena or materials provided will result in disqualified teams being banned from participating in future events hosted by [organiser name]. Disturbing others by not keeping a minimum specified distance will make them eligible for disqualification. In this challenge, you'll use your creativity, improvisation skills, and teamwork to help Zoro get through his obstacles. But don't worry, we've got your back—we're still going to be there if something goes wrong. If you fail to cooperate with the organizers or cause damage to the arena or any of its supplies (or if you break any rules), we will respond by disqualification.
